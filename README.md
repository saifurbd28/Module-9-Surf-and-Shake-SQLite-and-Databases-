# Overview
The profit of a business depends on many factors. One of them is a demand which is related to the weather conditions, especially for Surf & Ice Cream shops. As such, it is vital to know the weather information in two extreme seasons of the year – June & December. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis is to provide additional information about temperature trends on Oahu before opening the surf shop. We took data from the months of June and December to determine if the temperature year-round on Oahu is conducive to opening a Surf & Ice Cream Shop.

# Results
  
  	The average temperature in June is approximately 75°F±3.25°F (85°F - 64°F), whereas the December is 71°F±3.74°F (83°F - 56°F). So, December is certainly cooler than June. 

  	The fluctuation of temperatures in both months is almost the same (i.e., std is almost the same). It means the temperatures in these months will be constant with approximately 3°F to 4°F ups and downs. 

  	The quartile analyses reveal that the 50% of days of December will be ≥ 71°F, and 25% of days will be ≥74°F. That means, approximately one week of December will be summer-like weather. Importantly, only 25% of December days are ≤ 69°F; that is one relatively cooler week in this month.

# Summary
Since the ice cream consumption is weather dependent, its sales will be reduced in the month of December. In the case of surfing, it does not only depend on temperature but also other climate conditions such as wind, rain, and storms. Therefore, more data is required.
